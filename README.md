This assignment is designed to help me get started with R programming.

## Task 1: README.md
In this assignment, you'll create a GitHub repository named "st2195_assignment_1." Start by adding a README.md file to the repository. The README.md file should contain a brief description of the assignment and the tasks involved.

## Task 2: R Script in R-studio
Inside the repository, there's a folder named "r." Within this folder, create an R-studio project. Inside the project, write an R script (print_integers.R) that prints all integers between 1 and 10 (inclusive) to the screen.
