# Assignment 1: R Programming Basics
This assignment is designed to help me get started with R programming.

## Task 1: README.md
In this assignment, I have created a GitHub repository named "st2195_assignment_1." Started by adding a README.md file to the repository. The README.md file should contain a brief description of the assignment and the tasks involved.

## Task 2: R Script in R-studio
Inside the repository, there's a folder named "r." Within this folder, is an R-studio project. Inside the project, there is an R script (print_integers.R) that prints all integers between 1 and 10 (inclusive) to the screen.

## Instructions
Follow the step-by-step guide provided to complete each task. Remember to commit each item separately to the repository.

Happy coding!
